# PyBank
PyBank is one of the first Python homework assignments that I completed at the Columbia University Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, I extracted a .csv file from a local path and used a for loop to iterate through financial data. The final code will print out a .txt file containing analyses of financial data.
