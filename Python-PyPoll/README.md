# PyPoll
PyPoll is one of the first Python homework assignments that I completed at the Columbia University Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, I extracted a .csv file from a local path and used a for loop to iterate through polling data to determine the winner candidate. After the candidate has been selected, then the code will print out a .txt file containing analyses of polling data which includes the number and percentage of votes each candidate received.
